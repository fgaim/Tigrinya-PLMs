### Tigrinya Part-of-Speech Tagging

The original Nagaoka Tigrinya Corpus (NTC) prepared by Tedla et al. (2016) can be found [here](https://eng.jnlp.org/yemane/ntigcorpus).

For experimenetal purpose, we split the data into train-test parts with a ratio of 80-20, respectively, that we then used when comparing the monolingual and mutilingual models. For comparison with previous work, we also report performance of the best model, TiRoBERTa, based on a 10-fold evaluation.

If you want to get the exact train-test parts, please reach out to us via email `fitsum.gaim (at) kaist.ac.kr`.
