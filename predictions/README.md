## Model Predictions

This folder contains the model predictions for the two tasks. These were obtained by running the respective test sets through each of models.


#### Evaluation

The `eval.py` script could be used to compute the Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 scores of all predictions for the two tasks. The script has two dependencies, `sklearn` and `tabulate`, which can be installed with `pip`.

Run the script without any parameters:

```sh
python eval.py
```
